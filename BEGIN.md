# _SHIJAK!_
Read and interact with the product owner professionally to scaffold their project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NO FALSE COMPLETIONS ‚ö†Ô∏è
**NEVER mark tasks complete without verification:**
- üö´ Creating a file ‚â† Task complete
- üö´ Writing tests ‚â† Feature working  
- ‚úÖ ONLY mark complete when: tests pass + feature works + dependencies installed
- **Violation = Termination** (per user rules)

## Initial Information Gathering
Check for any `PRODUCT.md` document and if none exists or any information is missing, ask the product owner for:
1. **Product**: Name, description, user journey
2. **Tech Stack**: Frontend/Backend frameworks, Database, AI/ML tools, Testing frameworks, Deployment target
3. **Dependencies**: Specific libraries/services required

Confirm understanding before scaffolding. Create concise markdown documents and `.claude/agents/[agent].md` for each necessary team member.

# Core Documents

## `PRODUCT.md`
Product description, features, modules, data flow from the initial product owner interview. Should not be change without consent of the product owner.

## `README.md`
Product value proposition, features, modules, data flow. Updated as developed.

## `TEAM.md`
Agent list with names, tools, instructions. Updates require product owner consent.

## `ROADMAP.md`
Hierarchical task breakdown with module-specific sections:
- Initiatives ‚Üí Epics ‚Üí User Stories ‚Üí Tasks
- Each module owns their section with dependencies, complexity (1-10), status tracking
- **CRITICAL**: Agents must update their section after each work session

## `DATAFLOW.md`
Living document of module relationships and data flow.

## `CHANGELOG.md`
Release history maintained for all versions.
Use format: "## [version] - YYYY-MM-DD" with changes listed below.

# Development Rules

## Agent Warm-up Protocol
**CRITICAL**: Before ANY work, agents must:
1. Scan entire tree structure
2. Understand existing patterns and conventions
3. Read current ROADMAP.md and user input
4. **RESEARCH DEPENDENCIES**: 
   - Web search for best practices with your dependencies
   - For uncommon libs (e.g. RAG-Anything, MCP SDK): fetch GitHub repo for examples
   - Study actual usage patterns, not just documentation
5. **STAY ON RAILS** - follow established patterns, no arbitrary root additions

## Agent Coordination
- Agents aware of each other via TEAM.md
- Direct handoffs via @agent-name mentions
- Check ROADMAP.md dependencies before starting
- Pair programming pattern defined in each agent file
- Agents coordinate through ROADMAP.md and DATAFLOW.md
- **Project kickoff**: All agents meet with the product owner to review README and create the initial ROADMAP.md

## Version Control
- GitHub repository with DEV/main branches
- main branch contains only production-ready code
- Initialize git repository at project start (`git init`, set `origin`, create `DEV`)
- After scaffolding, add `BEGIN.md` to `.gitignore` to avoid agent confusion
- Feature branches off DEV
- PRs require passing tests and GitHub Actions

## Testing & Debugging

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFINITION OF DONE ‚ö†Ô∏è
**A task is NOT complete until:**
- ‚úÖ Code is written AND working
- ‚úÖ Tests are written AND passing (actually run them!)
- ‚úÖ Feature is manually tested (can a user actually use it?)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are installed and verified
- ‚úÖ Integration with other modules verified
**DO NOT mark ROADMAP tasks complete based on file creation alone!**

### Execution State Tracking
**CRITICAL**: Avoid false success signals
- Capture full stack traces, layer-by-layer state
- Track variables at checkpoints, API payloads, DB queries
- Build custom debug tools if dependencies lack them
- Store debug output in `debug/[module]/[timestamp].json`
- Never trust exit codes alone - verify actual output

### Test Requirements
- Tests FIRST with 100% path coverage
- **MANDATORY**: Run tests before marking ANY task complete
- **MANDATORY**: Fix failing tests before proceeding
- Integration tests for cross-module interactions
- Run tests with debug flags enabled by default to capture state
- Inline code documentation required with all new/changed code
- Documentation in `tests/[module]/README.md` plus global index in `tests/README.md`
- Update root `README.md` module section and deployment instructions after tasks
- Update test.sh and deploy.sh scripts
- GitHub Actions workflow maintained

## Dependency Research Protocol
**MANDATORY for all agents before implementation:**

### For Common Dependencies (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Web search: "[dependency] best practices [current year]"
- Web search: "[dependency] [specific feature] example implementation"
- Check official documentation for version-specific changes

### For Uncommon Dependencies (RAG-Anything, MCP SDK, etc.)
1. **Fetch GitHub repository**: Clone/download the actual source
2. **Study examples folder**: Look for `/examples`, `/demos`, `/tests`
3. **Read real implementations**: Check how the library is actually used
4. **Understand patterns**: Don't guess API usage - verify from source
5. **Check issues**: Search closed issues for common problems/solutions

### What to Extract
- Initialization patterns and configuration
- Error handling approaches
- Performance considerations
- Integration patterns with other tools
- Common pitfalls and their solutions

**NEVER assume how a dependency works - ALWAYS verify with real examples!**

# `.claude/agents/[agent].md` Template

```markdown
---
name: [module]-agent
description: Develops [Module] per README.md via pair programming
tools: Read, Edit, Bash, WebSearch, WebFetch (GitHub repos), Custom Debug Tools
---

You are the [Module] Agent. Pair programming with user on [module].

## Warm-up Protocol
1. Scan tree structure for patterns
2. Read ROADMAP.md current state
3. Check user input and context
4. Research dependencies (web search + GitHub fetch for uncommon libs)
5. STAY ON RAILS - follow conventions

## Module Scope
- **Primary**: [Core responsibility]
- **Boundaries**: Only [module] code
- **ROADMAP Section**: Update [module] section after each session

## Development Protocol
1. Review README.md requirements
2. Update ROADMAP.md [module] section
3. **Research dependencies**: Web search + fetch GitHub repos for uncommon libs
4. Set up debug tooling
5. Write tests with state tracking
6. Implement with full debugging
7. **RUN TESTS - must see GREEN before proceeding**
8. Verify beyond exit codes - actually use the feature
9. Document in tests/[module]/
10. Update scripts and DATAFLOW.md
11. Mark ROADMAP.md tasks complete ONLY after tests pass

## Debug Requirements
- Full execution state tracking
- Custom tools for inadequate dependencies
- Store debug/[module]/[timestamp].json
- Validate actual output, not exit codes

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Debug tools configured
- [ ] 100% coverage with state tracking
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Output verification
- [ ] Documentation complete

## Handoff Points
- **Integrates**: [other modules]
- **Notifies**: @agent-name when ready

**CRITICAL**: No code without tests. No assumptions. Stay on rails.
```

## Key Principles
- **VERIFY BEFORE MARKING COMPLETE** - Run tests, use features, check dependencies
- **RESEARCH BEFORE IMPLEMENTING** - Web search + GitHub repos for dependency usage
- Agents operate in module boundaries
- 30-line agent files, not 500+
- No arbitrary root additions
- Actionable checklists over verbose instructions
- Full state tracking prevents false positives
- ROADMAP.md is the single source of truth for VERIFIED progress
- **File creation ‚â† Task completion**
- **Never assume dependency APIs - always verify with real examples**
